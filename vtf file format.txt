 Quantec QMX VT file format


 Odd one this...


 Header, 0x0400 bytes.

 0000 V
 0003 A
 0006 L
 0009 I
 000C D
 000F A
 0014 T
 0017 E

Interleaved bytes may be random or have meaning, I don't know.
Following bytes are definitely left-over crap from memory.

Frames start at 0400  "New" file initialised at size 4K, 0400 onwards zeros apart
from a few bytes set near start of this part, but creating a frame doesn't add
anything at 0800, so may be junk.


Frame data format.  Aligned to 0x400 boundry

 0000 - 000D 		10 00 04 00 42 00 00 00 01 00 ff ff		04 00 - might be number of F records ?
 000C - 000D		Length of remaining data in record ? maybe - it doesn't seem right all the time


 It also seems that there may be "junk" data after the header before the start of
 the actual data - including apparent valid F record - see R.VTF 0x400. !

 000C - 000E		FE 01 46 	(FE 01 'F')
 000F - 001E		page number, 16 bytes, text, left justified, space filled.
 001F				a		frame id.
  0020-0025			00 00 00 00 00 nn - sequence number - increaments on each F block

  This lot seems to be record based - sections can, and do, appear in different orders !


 0025				80						?
 0026				60 ll hh 				CUG
 0029				61 ll hh 				price (x10)
 002C 				20 16 01 27 00			?
 0031				21 <9A 29> {AB} 59		last edit {date}/<time> in here somewhere

 					F0						if present, no user access
 	 				0A nn <text> 			free format note/command string
 0060				0C nn <text>			user-id of last editor eg 0C 06 SYSTEM

 0038				routing table....
					ten entries
						0x (x = route number 0-9)
						nn (length of following data)
						<text> (route, textual. * for no entry)
					00 nn <text>
					01 nn <text>
					02 nn <text>
					03 nn <text>
					04 nn <text>
					05 nn <text>
					06 nn <text>
					07 nn <text>
					08 nn <text>
					09 nn <text>
 					0e 01 2a	(route 14??? ) * means no route


					1c nn nn nn nn x..x page data ?? nmaybe
